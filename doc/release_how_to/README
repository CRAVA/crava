How to release a new version of CRAVA
=====================================

At each release we give Statoil the source code instead of binaries which 
they make themselves. This makes the release-procedure a bit cumbersome.

1. Check in a version of CRAVA in Subversion with the commit text "Release X.Y.Z", 
   where X.Y.Z is the version number. This text is useful when we later want to track 
   down the release in the revision system. Ensure that this version number is also 
   given in the initialisation of the program data in file main.cpp. Remove any 
   "beta" annotations. Example:

     Program program( 0,                     // Major version
                      9,                     // Minor version 
                      8,                     // Patch number 
                      "",                    // Use empty string "" for release versions 
                      -1,                    // Validity of licence in days (-1 = infinite)
                     "Norsk Regnesentral");  // Who this copy of CRAVA is licensed to

2. Update and compile the user manual with the same version number

3. Copy the entire CRAVA directory (this takes a looong time) 

     > cp -R trunk crava_prog_0.9.8

4. Clean up the copied code (to reduce the disk requirement)

     > cd crava_prog_0.9.8

     > make cleanall

In a standard release, remove the test suite:

     > rm -rf test_suite

If you want to include the test suite, replace the command above with

     > cd test_suite
     > rm -r */output
     > rm -rf .svn
     > rm -rf */.svn
     > rm -rf */*/.svn
     > rm -rf */*/*/.svn
     > rm -rf */*/*/*/.svn

5. Make an archive of the directory (there is no point in compressing the directory
   if the test_suite is still present since there are large binary files in the suite)
  
     > tar cvf crava_prog_0.9.8.tar crava_prog_0.9.8

6. Create a "randomly" named directory of eight letters under the www_ekstern directory 
   of your home directory and put the archive in it. Make sure that this directory is 
   fully readable and executable and that the archive is also fully readable:

     > cd $HOME/www_ekstern
     > mkdir f8eu3j2d
     > chmod a+rx f8eu3j2d
     > cp /some-place/crava_prog_0.9.8.tar ./
     > chmod a+r crava_prog_0.9.8.tar 

7. Send a release-e-mail. Make sure to send a copy of the mail to yourself so that 
   you can verify that the link you supply the recipients are alive. The link will
   look something like:

     http://www.nr.no/~your-login-name/f8eu3j2d/crava_prog_0.9.8.tar 

   For a standard release-e-mail and recipients see the files
  
     release-text
     release-mottakere

8. Update the version number in main.cpp. For the example above you would use '0.9.9 beta'.
